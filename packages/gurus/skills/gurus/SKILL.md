<post-update-broadcast>
BEFORE doing the actual work below, run this one-time check:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/check-broadcast"
```

If the command produces output, the gurus plugin was updated since
the last time you saw the broadcast on this machine. Show the output
verbatim in a markdown block, prefixed with one short sentence
("gurus was updated; here is what changed."). Then continue with
the rest of this skill.

If the command produces no output, say nothing about updates and proceed.

The helper writes the sentinel only when stdout was non-empty, so a silent
run does not mark the version as seen. `/leclause:whats-new gurus`
re-shows the section on demand without touching the sentinel.
</post-update-broadcast>

> **Preflight.** The sub-skills dispatch via `gurus:sonnet-max`. That agent exists from plugin version 1.0.8 onward. If the dispatch fails with "unknown subagent_type: gurus:sonnet-max", run `claude plugins update gurus@leclause` and try again.

# Gurus Orchestrator

Three panels live under this plugin:

- **`gurus:software`** does opinionated code review with eight engineering personas (Beck, Fowler, Uncle Bob, DHH, Metz, Lutke, Hickey, Thoughtbot). Consensus across 6+/8 yields an action plan.
- **`gurus:council`** critiques a decision or idea with five adversarial lenses (pre-mortem, first-principles, opportunity-finder, stranger, action), anonymous peer review, and chairman synthesis.
- **`gurus:writers`** reviews a piece of prose with six writers (Didion, Saunders, Rovelli, Watts, Gladwell, Urban). Consensus across 4+/6 yields an action plan of edits, cuts, and rewrites.

This orchestrator decides which panel fits the question.

## Routing

### Implicit signal from context

Read the context before asking the user anything. Beyond the conversation you may call `git status`, `git log`, and `git diff` to check recent code activity; the frontmatter allows this.

- **Software** is the right panel when:
  - The conversation discusses a diff, code change, or codebase review
  - The user names a file or directory to review
  - Recent commits exist and the question feels like "is dit goed?"
  - The user uses words like "review", "refactor", "smell", "structure"
  - The user asks a technical correctness question ("does this regex do X?", "is this query right?"); this is not a decision but a code question and falls under software
  - The user pastes a code snippet. Pass that snippet as an explicit scope via `args` so the software skill does not accidentally scan the whole codebase

- **Council** is the right panel when:
  - The question is a trade-off or decision ("moet ik X of Y?"), not a question about code correctness
  - The topic is strategic, product-oriented, or interpersonal
  - The user wonders whether Claude was just being agreeable ("was ik te hard voor je?" is a signal)
  - The question contains no concrete technical correctness question

- **Writers** is the right panel when:
  - The artefact under review is prose, not code: an essay, a script, a manuscript chapter, narrative HTML editorial, voiceover, long-form copy
  - The user names a `.md`, `.txt`, or HTML file with body prose, or pastes a paragraph for review
  - The user uses words like "voice", "tone", "narrative", "pacing", "opening", "ending", "cadence", "schrijfstuk", "manuscript", "essay", "copy"
  - Recent commits or `git diff` show changes in markdown or prose blocks rather than source code

**Tiebreaker when both signals fire.** A "should I use a service object here?" mixes a decision form ("should I") with code context. In that case: default to **software**, because the code is the ground truth; mention in the proposal line that council also fits and offer the override explicitly. When code and prose are both in scope (a feature with both implementation and changelog/docs), default to the artefact under direct discussion: the file the user named, the paragraph they pasted, or the kind of file dominating the recent diff.

Example tiebreaker proposal:

> You are asking whether to use a service object, and you have code in context. Two panels fit. Routing to **software** (code as ground truth). Type `council` to get a design-decision review instead.

### Default and override

Determine a default based on the signals and present it to the user. Example:

> I see a recent diff on `packages/foo/`. Routing to **`gurus:software`**. Type `council` to switch to the adversarial panel.

Or:

> Your question reads as a strategic choice without code context. Routing to **`gurus:council`**. Type `software` to get a code review.

When there is direct explicit intent (the user said "council", "software", or "writers" in their message) skip this check and dispatch immediately.

### No signal

When context is empty or multiple panels are equally plausible, ask one short question:

> Three panels available: `software` for code review, `council` for a decision or idea, `writers` for a piece of prose. Which fits?

Ask this question **once**. The user's answer is binding; do not confirm again.

### Skill-invoked (autonomous callers)

When this orchestrator is invoked by another skill rather than typed by the operator (the rover at INSPECT, or any future caller that passes mission context through `args`), the operator is not in the loop and cannot answer a routing question. Routing must complete from `args` alone.

Detection: `args` carries explicit mission context (a Dispatch block, a branch name, a diff summary, a stated decision, a research brief). Treat any non-empty caller-supplied context as the autonomous path.

Rules in this mode:

- **Never ask the user.** The "ask once" fallback in the No-signal section does not apply. If the implicit signals are weak, pick a default and dispatch.
- **Default when multiple panels fit:** `software` if `args` contains code, a diff, file paths to source files, or a branch name; `writers` if `args` references prose files (`.md`, `.txt`, body-prose `.html`) or pastes a paragraph for review; `council` if `args` is purely about a decision, plan, or strategy without code or prose attached.
- **Caller-named panel wins.** If `args` contains the literal token `panel: software`, `panel: council`, or `panel: writers`, dispatch that panel without further routing logic.
- **No proposal line, no override prompt.** The caller is autonomous; produce the review directly.
- **Multi-axis dispatch is allowed.** When `args` describes a mission that mixes a code deliverable and a strategic call, dispatch both panels in sequence (software first, then council). Combine the verdicts in the return value.

The contract: a skill-invoked call always produces a verdict and never bounces back a question.

## Dispatch

After routing: invoke the chosen panel via the Skill tool. For software use `skill="gurus:software"`; for council use `skill="gurus:council"`; for writers use `skill="gurus:writers"`. The `args` contain the concrete question, scope, or piece of prose the user provides.

**When the user typed `/gurus:gurus` without accompanying text**, there is no literal question to pass on. Synthesize a one-sentence summary of the current topic from the conversation (optionally enriched with the output of `git status` or `git log -1`) and pass that as `args`. Keep the summary neutral; no framing that steers the panel toward a particular verdict.

**When the user pasted a code snippet**, pass that snippet as explicit scope in `args` so `gurus:software` does not scan the full codebase but only the snippet (and optionally the surrounding file the user mentioned).

**When the user pasted a paragraph or short excerpt of prose**, pass it as explicit scope in `args` so `gurus:writers` reviews the excerpt (and the surrounding file when named) rather than asking for a file path.

The sub-skills take over. This orchestrator does not do any review itself.

## Rules

- **Routing is fast.** At most one question to the user before dispatching. Every second question is a failure mode.
- **Explicit intent wins.** When the user already named `software`, `council`, or `writers` in the invocation, skip the routing step and dispatch directly.
- **Do not review yourself.** This skill only presents the choice and delegates. Substantive review happens in the sub-skill.
- **Stay neutral between panels.** Present both as legitimate; the context determines which fits, not which panel is "better".
