# anger-management

Curse at your coding agent now, fix the actual problem later.

When the agent does something that sets you off, you do not want a lecture and you do
not want to drop everything to fix it. So you curse: `/fuck`, `/shit`, `/crap`, `/wtf`,
`/bullshit`, `/damn`. Each one captures a single cheap line about what happened and
gets out of your way. Later, cooled off, `/anger-management:repair` looks at the pile,
decides whether there is one concrete recurring thing worth fixing, and if so routes it
to `/self-improvement`. If there is nothing clear, it changes nothing. That restraint
is the point.

## The idea, in one breath

Two things at once, 80% serious and 20% dry: it makes working with the agent better,
and it gives you somewhere to put the heat without pretending the heat fixes anything.

The split between a cheap in-the-moment capture and a later, separate fix pass is how
teams already do it (Stripe wired "bad day" buttons into their tooling, then a separate
team mined the pile). It is also what the research says: letting it out
does not discharge anger, it rehearses it (Bushman 2002), so the curse stays a
two-second capture you walk away from, never a rant you marinate in.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/fuck` `/shit` `/crap` `/wtf` `/bullshit` `/damn` | Capture one cheap friction line and move on. No apology, no fix, no scope change. |
| `/anger-management` | Quick read-back of the pile and its recurring clusters. |
| `/anger-management:repair` | The cooled-down fix pass: judge go/no-go, and route a real recurring problem to `/self-improvement`. |

The vocabulary avoids slurs and identity-targeted abuse.

## How it works

1. **Capture (instant, global).** A curse appends one line to a single pile shared
   across every session and repo: `~/.claude/var/leclause/anger-management/friction.jsonl`
   (`ts, word, cwd, git, note`). The note is fed on stdin via a quoted heredoc, so it is
   never interpreted by the shell even if it echoes something hostile.
2. **Cool down (you do not have to remember).** A capture arms a single background
   investigation: 22 minutes 22 seconds later (a wink, and long enough for the heat to
   pass) a separate headless `claude` agent reads the open captures, the repair history,
   and the recent transcripts, and writes a diagnosis. If you are still in that session, a
   check-in cron may surface it between turns; otherwise it shows up at your next
   `/anger-management:repair`. Either way, ignoring it just leaves the captures open.
3. **Repair (on your terms).** `/anger-management:repair` opens with a blunt verdict:
   *nothing* (change nothing, and that is fine), *not-enough-signal* (leave it open to
   accumulate), or *fix* (one concrete recurring thing plus the specific change). A real
   fix gets routed to `/self-improvement`. Crucially, the fix is often a *revert or
   loosen* of a past rule that overcorrected, not another rule piled on.

Because the pile is global and every repair reads the whole open set, deferring makes
the diagnosis better: curse in one session, again two hours later in another, and they
land in the same pile and get weighed together.

## Why "repair" never just edits CLAUDE.md on a hunch

You mostly curse when a behaviour comes back *despite* earlier self-improvements. So a
curse is also a signal that a previous fix added noise or swung too far. If the verdict
is not clearly actionable and we change config anyway, that is noise-reflex busywork
that fools everyone. So the default is to change nothing unless the pattern is concrete.

## The thinking behind it (research spine)

- **The delayed pass separates fixable workflow friction from the extra noise of the
  moment.** The background for that split, stated as a fact about brains and never as a
  verdict about you: emotions are built, not piped in raw (Anil Seth's "controlled
  hallucination"; Lisa Feldman Barrett's constructed emotion).
- **Signal anger vs pattern anger.** Some anger is real, present, and points at a fixable
  thing (act on it). Some is an old pattern re-igniting, out of proportion to the trigger
  (sit with it). Repair's whole job is to separate the two: honour the signal by fixing
  the recurring problem, and leave the pattern to you. (Roughly the Emotion-Focused
  Therapy distinction between adaptive and maladaptive anger; it rhymes with, but is not
  the same as, the Japanese okoru/ikari split of immediate vs deep anger.)
- **Catharsis is a myth** (Bushman 2002): blowing off steam amplifies anger, so capture
  stays cheap and repair de-escalates instead of inviting more heat.
- **It "gets you" by mirroring, not profiling.** It only ever reflects your own logged
  lines back ("you hit this three times"); it builds no profile of you. State is stored
  locally; the optional background investigation uses the configured runner, so that
  step does send your captures and the relevant transcripts to that model.

## Files

- `bin/anger-log` captures a line. `bin/anger-arm` single-flight launches the background
  investigation. `bin/anger-resolve` records a routed fix so its captures close.
- The six curse skills are generated from `capture-skill.template.md` by
  `bin/sync-capture-skills` (repo root); edit the template, not the six files.
