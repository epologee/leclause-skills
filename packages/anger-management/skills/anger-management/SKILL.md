description: Invoked as /anger-management. A quick read-back of the curse-capture log and its recurring clusters; for the actual fix pass use /anger-management:repair. Runs only when the operator types it.
effort: low

<post-update-broadcast>
BEFORE doing the actual work below, run this one-time check:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/check-broadcast"
```

If the command produces output, the anger-management plugin was updated since
the last time you saw the broadcast on this machine. Show the output
verbatim in a markdown block, prefixed with one short sentence
("anger-management was updated; here is what changed."). Then continue with
the rest of this skill.

If the command produces no output, say nothing about updates and proceed.

The helper writes the sentinel only when stdout was non-empty, so a silent
run does not mark the version as seen. `/leclause:whats-new anger-management`
re-shows the section on demand without touching the sentinel.

# Anger Management

The curse commands (`/fuck`, `/shit`, `/crap`, `/wtf`, `/bullshit`, `/damn`) capture
one cheap friction line and let the operator get back to work. This skill is the quick
glance at that pile. For the real cooled-down fix pass (the go/no-go judgement, routing
to self-improvement), use **`/anger-management:repair`**; this one just shows what is in
the log.

## The log

One global pile across every session and repo:

```
~/.claude/var/leclause/anger-management/friction.jsonl
```

Each line: `{ "ts", "word", "cwd", "git", "note" }`. Cheap on the capture side; the
value is in the aggregate.

## What to do

A read-back, proportional to what is there. No fixing here, that is `repair`'s job.

1. Read the log. No file or an empty one means nothing is captured yet: say so, point
   at the curse commands as what fills it, stop.
2. Surface the signal: cluster what recurs (same project via cwd/git, or the same theme
   across projects). Count, do not transcribe. A lone capture is a bad moment, not a
   pattern.
3. Show the top recurring frictions, worst first: what it is, how often, where it bites.
4. Point at the next step: `/anger-management:repair` is what actually judges whether
   there is something concrete to fix and routes it. Do not route anything yourself
   here.

## Notes

Match the operator's language. The log is the operator's: if they want it cleared, point
at the path, do not truncate it unprompted.

## Arguments

- No argument: full read-back of the recurring clusters.
- `<text>`: filter to a word, project, or theme and report only that slice.
