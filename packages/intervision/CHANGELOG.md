# intervision changelog

Each entry corresponds to the `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. The
post-update broadcast (see `bin/check-broadcast`) shows the section for the
currently-installed version exactly once per machine. Use
`/leclause:whats-new intervision` to re-read at any time.

Categories:

- **Breaking**: user must adapt
- **Added**: new commands, new optional behavior
- **Changed**: non-breaking adjustments worth knowing about
- **Fixed**: silent unless the bug was user-visible

Patch-level fixes that change nothing the user can observe are intentionally
omitted; the broadcast budget is for things the user benefits from knowing.
The helper writes the sentinel only when stdout is non-empty, so a CHANGELOG
without a `## [vX.Y.Z]` section stays silent on every update.

## [v1.0.1]

### Added

- New plugin. `/intervision:confer` brings Codex in as a peer to review work
  just done or just discussed via `codex exec`, surfaces its independent read,
  and confers back and forth. Needs the `codex` CLI installed and logged in.
