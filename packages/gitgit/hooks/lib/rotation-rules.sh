# Sourceable mnemonic-passwords for the commit-subject rotation reminders.
# Each ack must match the password tied to its rule number, e.g.
# `# ack-rule8:inferno`. The password is referential to the rule (vivid
# image you can hook the rule onto), so looking it up in the skill forces
# one exposure to the rule text per ack cycle. The skill at
# packages/gitgit/skills/commit-discipline/SKILL.md (section "Rotation
# reminders") is the canonical reference; this file is its enforcement
# mirror.

# Indexed 0-based: DD_RULE_PASSWORD[N-1] is the password for rule N.
# Rule 3 is owned by commit-format and not in the rotation; its slot stays
# empty so the index math lines up with the rule number.
