# /gitgit:enable-git

Remove the per-repo lock that `/gitgit:disable-git` set. After this command
Claude is free to run mutating git commands again. Has no effect when no
sentinel is present.

## Implementation

Perform the following steps:

1. Resolve the git common dir:

   ```bash
   common_dir=$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir 2>/dev/null)
   ```

   Bail with a clear error when not inside a git repo.

2. Remove the sentinel if it exists:

   ```bash
   sentinel="$common_dir/gitgit-deny"
   if [[ -f "$sentinel" ]]; then
     rm "$sentinel"
     echo "git lock removed: $sentinel"
   else
     echo "no git lock was active for this repo"
   fi
   ```

3. Confirm to the operator which path was removed.

Do not write further explanation or caveats afterwards. The operator
typed this command deliberately.
