# /gitgit:rebase-latest-default Skill

Rebase the current branch on the latest version of the default branch. The target can be a local branch (e.g. `main`) or a remote tracking branch (e.g. `origin/main`), whichever is further ahead. This supports worktree setups where the main worktree has unpushed commits, and repos without a remote.

## Step 0: Detect Default Branch and Rebase Target

### 0a: Find the default branch name

Determine the default branch name (`$DEFAULT`):

1. Try `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` and extract the branch name (e.g. `main`).
2. If that fails (no remote, or ref not set), check which of `main` or `master` exists locally via `git rev-parse --verify refs/heads/main` and `git rev-parse --verify refs/heads/master`. Prefer `main` if both exist.
3. If neither exists, stop and ask the user.

### 0b: Determine the rebase target

Check which references to `$DEFAULT` exist:

```bash
git rev-parse --verify refs/heads/$DEFAULT 2>/dev/null
```
```bash
git rev-parse --verify refs/remotes/origin/$DEFAULT 2>/dev/null
```

Based on availability, determine `$TARGET`:

- **Both exist:** Compare which is ahead:
  ```bash
  git rev-list --left-right --count refs/heads/$DEFAULT...refs/remotes/origin/$DEFAULT
  ```
  Left count = commits in local not in origin (local ahead). Right count = commits in origin not in local (origin ahead). If origin is strictly ahead (right > 0, left = 0), use `origin/$DEFAULT`. If both have diverged (left > 0 AND right > 0), warn: `Local $DEFAULT and origin/$DEFAULT have diverged (<left> and <right> commits respectively). Rebasing on local. Consider fetching and fast-forwarding local $DEFAULT first.` Then use `$DEFAULT` (local). If local is ahead or equal, use `$DEFAULT` (local). Report which target was chosen and why.
- **Only local exists:** Use `$DEFAULT`. No staleness check needed.
- **Only remote exists:** Use `origin/$DEFAULT`. Proceed to Step 1 (staleness check).
- **Neither exists:** Stop and ask the user.

## Step 1: Staleness Check (remote targets only)

Skip this step entirely when `$TARGET` is a local branch.

When `$TARGET` is `origin/$DEFAULT`, check if the tracking ref matches the remote without fetching. Run these as **separate Bash calls**:

```bash
git rev-parse refs/remotes/origin/$DEFAULT
```
```bash
git ls-remote origin refs/heads/$DEFAULT
```

Compare the SHAs:

- **If they match:** proceed to Step 2.
- **If they differ:** show a warning and **stop**:
  ```
  origin/$DEFAULT is stale (local: <short-sha>, remote: <short-sha>).
  Run `git fetch origin` first, then invoke /gitgit:rebase-latest-default again.
  ```
  Do NOT proceed with the rebase. Do NOT fetch. The user must fetch explicitly because fetching updates all remote tracking refs, which affects `--force-with-lease` behavior on other branches.

## Step 2: Pre-rebase Guards

First, check if the current branch IS the default branch:

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

If the current branch equals `$DEFAULT`, report `You are on $DEFAULT, nothing to rebase.` and stop.

Then, check for uncommitted changes:

```bash
git status --porcelain
```

If the output is non-empty, report `Working tree is dirty. Stash or commit your changes first.` and stop.

## Step 3: Pre-rebase State

Record the current state so the user can assess the rebase afterward:

```bash
git rev-list --left-right --count $TARGET...HEAD
```

Report: `Branch is <ahead> commits ahead, <behind> commits behind $TARGET.`

If the branch is 0 commits behind, report `Already up to date with $TARGET.` and stop.

## Step 4: Rebase

```bash
git rebase $TARGET
```

- **If the rebase succeeds cleanly:** proceed to Step 5.
- **If the rebase hits conflicts:** proceed to Step 4a.

## Step 4a: Resolve Conflicts

When a rebase stops on conflicts:

1. Read each conflicting file to understand both sides.
2. Resolve the conflicts. Use your understanding of the codebase and the intent of both sides to produce the correct merge. Prefer the branch's intent when it deliberately diverges from the default branch (that's the point of the branch). Prefer the default branch's version for incidental changes (renames, formatting, new imports).
3. Stage the resolved files and continue:
   ```bash
   git add <resolved-files>
   ```
   ```bash
   git rebase --continue
   ```
4. Repeat if the rebase stops on further commits.
5. If a conflict is genuinely ambiguous (both sides made intentional, incompatible changes to the same logic), stop and describe the conflict to the user instead of guessing.

## Step 5: After Rebase

Report the result: how many commits ahead of `$TARGET`, and whether conflicts were resolved (and if so, which files). No proactive suggestions beyond that. The user will push or take further action when ready.
