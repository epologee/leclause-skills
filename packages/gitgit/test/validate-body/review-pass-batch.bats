Address pride findings on the IAP refactor

The pride contrarian pass surfaced three findings:
- Domain enum carries Dutch UI copy
- Two parallel @State variables for one outcome
- private(set) leaks the mock value into Release

Tests: spec/services/foo_spec.rb
Slice: handler + view
Red-then-green: yes

_body_review_pass_one_finding_prose() {
  cat <<MSG
Move IAP user copy out of the domain enum

The pride contrarian pass found that PurchaseOutcome.failed carried a
Dutch UI string in the domain layer; the view should map a typed
reason to its Dutch label, not the model. This commit moves the copy
to the view via a typed PurchaseFailureReason enum.

Tests: spec/services/foo_spec.rb
Slice: handler + view
Red-then-green: yes
MSG

Drop several deprecated permissions from the manifest

The new permissions model removed:
- camera permission (replaced by photo picker)
- microphone permission (no audio capture in v2)
- contacts permission (never requested in v2 UI)

Slice: config-only
