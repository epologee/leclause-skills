# Push/rebase re-validation must not re-run state-dependent path checks.
#
# The push-body-gate walks the push range and calls validate_body once per
# commit with GITGIT_VALIDATE_CONTEXT=<sha>. At that point the path-existence
# checks (Tests path in tree/delta, Red-then-green path in delta, Visual path
# on disk, Verified path on disk) are anachronistic: a /tmp screenshot is long
# gone, a spec has moved, an already-merged commit's spec is in a different
# commit's delta. Those checks are only meaningful at commit time, where the
# context is "staged" (normal commit) or "HEAD" (amend).
#
# Each behaviour is asserted as a pair: the check fires at commit time and is
# skipped on push (sha) re-validation. A final test proves the structural
# safety-net (trailer presence) survives in every context, so a body shipped
# via --no-verify is still caught at push.
