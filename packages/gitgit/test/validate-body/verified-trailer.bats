# Verified trailer: self-assessment of how the behaviour change was verified.
# Closed set of forms: operator-confirmed, <artefact path>, red-then-green,
# n/a (reason). Forces an explicit answer to "did the operator see this
# work, is there a screenshot, or was there a red-then-green test" so a
# commit cannot slip through on bare attestation. build-only was removed.
