# Empty repo / unreadable HEAD handling for the rotation. When
# `git rev-parse HEAD` returns nothing (no commits yet), the guard
# must let the initial commit through so a fresh `git init` repo can
# escape the Catch-22 (no commits without ack-resolution, no
# ack-resolution without HEAD). It writes "0" as the pending value:
# valid hex (survives the state-loader tr -cd '0-9a-f' strip), one
# char (cannot collide with a real 40-char sha), and visibly a
# sentinel on inspection. The next dispatcher pass compares the real
# HEAD sha against "0", detects a move, and advances the rotation. If
# the initial commit fails, HEAD stays absent and the symmetric
# empty-HEAD branch clears the pending without advancing.
