# now lives in guards/commit-trailers.sh:
#
#   - Co-Authored-By with @anthropic.com is denied (exit 2) with mnemonic.
#   - Co-Authored-By with a non-anthropic email passes (exit 0).
#   - GITGIT_ALLOW_AI_COAUTHOR=1 bypasses the guard silently.
#   - A commit body without any Co-Authored-By trailer passes silently.
