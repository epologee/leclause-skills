# Verifies the absorbed ~/.claude/hooks/block-git-dash-c.sh behaviour now
# lives in guards/git-dash-c.sh:
#
#   - `git -C <dir> ...` is denied with the git-dash-c mnemonic and the
#     suggested `cd <dir>` rewrite in the message.
#   - Plain `git status` (no -C) passes silently.
#   - Lowercase `-c` (config override) is unaffected.
#   - `-C` later in the command line is unaffected (the guard only blocks at
#     the start position, matching the original regex anchor).
