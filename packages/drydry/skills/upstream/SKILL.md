  Internal sub-skill of the drydry plugin. Dispatched by the drydry:drydry
  orchestrator in audit mode when a framework or library is detected or
  named, or directly when the operator wants only a cross-toolbox audit.
  Detects installed frameworks from manifest files (Gemfile, Package.swift,
  package.json, pyproject.toml). For each framework, spawns a Sonnet
  subagent that compares operator helpers against framework-provided
  functionality and produces drift hypotheses for each duplication.
  Uses inspire and ground patterns to verify the framework actually
  offers the helper before reporting. Returns findings the orchestrator
  folds into the audit artefact under "## Upstream duplication".

# Upstream

The cross-toolbox audit pass behind the drydry pipeline. The premise: DRY violations between operator code and framework code are invisible from a single-codebase view. A homegrown `current_user` helper looks fine until you remember Devise ships one; the silent drift risk surfaces at the next Devise upgrade. Not user-invocable.

## Input contract

Caller supplies through `args`:

- **`project_root`**: path to the project root. Mandatory.
- **`framework_hint`**: optional name of a specific framework to audit (`devise`, `active-job`, `swiftui`, `combine`, `react-router`, `tanstack-query`, ...). When absent, the skill auto-detects from manifests.
- **`scope`**: optional sub-directory; when provided, the audit is limited to that scope.
- **`max_helpers_per_framework`**: optional cap, default 10. Prevents one framework with broad surface from dominating.

## Output contract

Return a markdown section the orchestrator folds into the audit artefact:

```markdown
## Upstream duplication

### Framework: <framework_name> <version_if_known>

- Finding 1
  - operator_helper: `<path>:<line>` `<symbol_name>`
  - upstream_offering: `<framework_module>.<symbol>` (cite the docs URL)
  - duplication_kind: identical | partial | semantic
  - drift_hypothesis: <one sentence; the Chapter 4 test must pass>
  - upgrade_risk: <what breaks when the framework version moves>
  - convergence_path: <replace operator helper with upstream | wrap upstream | keep as documented divergence>
  - verifier_command: <runnable command to re-find both sites>
```

Findings without a verified upstream offering (the verification check failed) are dropped.

When a framework is detected but no findings survive verification, emit the header alone with an explicit empty marker so the orchestrator's fold-in step does not silently omit the framework:

```markdown
### Framework: <framework_name> <version_if_known>

_no upstream duplications found; the verification pass dropped every candidate. See "## Detection method chosen" for which candidates were inspected._
```

## Workflow

### 1. DETECT frameworks

Walk `project_root` for known manifest signatures:

| Manifest | Frameworks to consider |
|----------|------------------------|
| `Gemfile` / `Gemfile.lock` | Rails, Devise, Pundit, CanCanCan, Sidekiq, Active Job, dry-rb, RSpec, FactoryBot |
| `Package.swift` / `*.xcodeproj` | SwiftUI, UIKit, Combine, swift-collections, Vapor |
| `package.json` | React, Next, Remix, TanStack Query, React Router, Vue, Svelte, lodash, date-fns |
| `pyproject.toml` / `requirements.txt` | Django, Flask, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, pydantic |
| `Cargo.toml` | actix, axum, serde, tokio |
| `go.mod` | gin, echo, chi, sqlx |

When `framework_hint` is set, audit only that framework; skip auto-detection. When auto-detecting, parse the manifest and pick the three to five most load-bearing frameworks (the ones whose absence would break the project).

### 2. INSPECT operator helpers

For each framework selected, identify the operator's helper-shaped code: standalone utility modules, "helpers/" directories, `Extensions.swift`-style files, `lib/` directories. Run a grep with framework-relevant signatures (`def current_user`, `func authenticated`, `useAuth`, `useToast`, `formatDate`, ...) to find candidates.

Each candidate becomes a tuple `(helper_path:line, symbol_name, surface)` for the duplication subagent.

### 3. SPAWN duplication subagent per framework

For each framework, spawn one Sonnet Agent with this brief (inspire-style for the discovery, ground-style for the verification):

```
You audit a project for duplication of <framework> functionality.

Operator helpers (candidates): <list of tuples>

Tasks:
1. For each candidate, search the <framework> documentation
   (WebSearch + WebFetch) for an upstream symbol that does the same
   job. Cite the canonical docs URL.
2. ground-style verification: confirm the symbol actually exists in
   the version of <framework> the project pins (read Gemfile.lock,
   Package.resolved, package-lock.json). If you cannot verify the
   symbol exists in the pinned version, mark the candidate dropped
   and explain why.
3. Classify duplication: identical (operator helper is a thin wrapper
   matching upstream signature), partial (overlap with extra concern),
   semantic (same purpose, different shape, Type-4).
4. Write a drift hypothesis: what bad thing happens when the
   framework version moves and the operator helper does not?
5. Produce a verifier_command (rg or grep) that re-finds both sites.

Return one finding per verified candidate. Drop unverified candidates.
Drop candidates where the duplication is genuinely deliberate (the
operator's helper adds value the upstream does not provide; explain
in one sentence).
```

### 4. CAP and RETURN

Apply `max_helpers_per_framework` per framework. Return the assembled markdown to the caller.

## Common upstream-duplication patterns to watch for

These are seed examples the subagent's brief includes so the search has direction:

### Rails

- `current_user` helpers that mirror Devise's `current_<scope>`
- Custom `before_action :authenticate!` chains that duplicate Devise's `authenticate_<scope>!`
- Hand-rolled background-job retry loops that duplicate `retry_on` from Active Job
- Custom `assert_difference`-style helpers that duplicate ActiveSupport's `assert_changes`
- Bespoke string slug methods that duplicate ActiveSupport's `parameterize`

### SwiftUI / Foundation

- Custom `.task { }` wrappers around `URLSession` that duplicate `async/await` URLSession APIs
- Hand-rolled `ObservableObject` patterns that duplicate `@Observable` macro behaviour (Swift 5.9+)
- Custom date-formatting helpers that duplicate `Date.FormatStyle`
- Custom locale-aware string interpolation that duplicates `String(localized:)`

### React / TypeScript

- Custom `useAsync` hooks that duplicate TanStack Query's `useQuery`
- Hand-rolled cache-and-revalidate logic that duplicates SWR or TanStack Query
- Bespoke form-state hooks duplicating React Hook Form
- Hand-rolled focus-trap hooks duplicating Radix or Reach focus-trap primitives

### Django / Python

- Custom permission-check decorators that duplicate `permission_required`
- Hand-rolled query-aggregation helpers that duplicate `annotate` / `aggregate`
- Custom validation decorators duplicating Django form `clean_*` patterns

The subagent uses these as priors, not a closed list.

## Rules

- **Verification before reporting.** A finding lands only if the upstream symbol is confirmed to exist in the pinned framework version (`ground`-style discipline). The operator's pinned version, not the latest version.
- **Drift hypothesis is mandatory.** A finding without a Chapter 4 sentence is dropped. "It would be cleaner to use Devise" is not a drift hypothesis; "Devise's session-token storage changed in 4.9 and the operator's hand-rolled helper will silently miss the new format on the next upgrade" is.
- **Deliberate divergence is not a finding.** When the operator helper exists because the framework's shape was insufficient (rate-limiting, multi-tenancy, an extra concern), the subagent drops the candidate. Drydry is not "use upstream for everything"; it is "duplications that will silently drift hurt you".
- **No auto-fix.** This skill returns findings the orchestrator folds into the audit artefact. The operator decides whether to converge.
