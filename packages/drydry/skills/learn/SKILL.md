  Internal sub-skill of the drydry plugin. Dispatched by the drydry:drydry
  orchestrator when the operator asks "what does the world say about
  duplication?" or "update the checklist seeds", or directly when an
  external trigger wants to enrich the drydry pattern vocabulary.
  Spawns parallel Sonnet research agents (WebSearch + WebFetch) across
  five tracks: clone-detection literature, LLM and agent failure-mode
  write-ups, framework-specific deduplication patterns, design-system
  convergence techniques, and prose-deduplication tactics. Synthesises
  findings into checklist enrichment proposals and writes them to
  ~/.claude/drydry/learnings/<date>-<topic>.md. One-shot, not scheduled.

# Learn

The online research pass behind the drydry plugin. Enriches the checklist vocabulary by reading what the broader community has written about parallel-paths detection in the last year, then writes checklist-enrichment proposals into `~/.claude/drydry/learnings/`. Not user-invocable; the operator types `/drydry:drydry learn <topic>` and the orchestrator routes here.

The premise: the whole Claude-coding world is running into the same kind of duplication, because agents systematically generate fresh code over reusing existing code. Standing still means falling behind. A periodic `learn` pass keeps the checklist seeds and the verifier conventions current.

## Input contract

Caller supplies through `args`:

- **`topic`**: optional topic narrowing (e.g., "swift-app-intents", "rails-service-objects", "react-form-state", "design-token-drift"). When absent, `learn` runs a broad sweep across all five tracks.
- **`depth`**: optional `quick` / `normal` / `deep`. Default `normal`. Quick is one round per track; deep is two rounds plus a contrarian pass (mirrors the `recursion:research` schema).
- **`since`**: optional date stamp (`2025-01-01`). Filters search queries to the named window. Default is the date of the most recent file in `~/.claude/drydry/learnings/`, or "last 12 months" when the folder is empty.

## Output contract

A markdown file at `~/.claude/drydry/learnings/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<topic-or-broad>.md` with three sections:

```markdown
## Detection method chosen

<scope, tracks, agents, search windows, sources crawled>

## New patterns

For each candidate pattern the research surfaced:

### <pattern_id>: <short title>

<one-paragraph description, sourced from the citations below>

Signatures to look for:
- `<grep-friendly regex or token>`

Sources:
- <URL>: <one-line takeaway>
- <URL>: <one-line takeaway>

Confidence: robust | probable | fragile (Round-3 contrarian verdict)

Proposed seed domain: <ios-swiftui | rails | react-typescript | markdown-prose | design-tokens | generic>

## Verifier-convention updates

<any new verifier tactic or anti-pattern the research surfaced>
```

The file is **not** auto-merged into the seed templates in `drydry:checklist`. The operator reads the file and decides which proposals to fold in.

## Workflow

Mirror the `recursion:research` schema, narrowed to the drydry domain.

### 1. PREPARE

1. Date: `date +%Y-%m-%d`.
2. `mkdir -p ~/.claude/drydry/learnings`.
3. Read the most recent file in `~/.claude/drydry/learnings/` to set the default `since` window.
4. Read `packages/drydry/skills/checklist/SKILL.md` for the current seed templates (so the research does not re-propose existing patterns).
5. Read the current `args.topic` and decide which of the five tracks are in scope.

### 2. RESEARCH

#### Round 1: Parallel exploration (5 tracks, 1 Sonnet agent per track)

Spawn five agents in parallel via the Agent tool with `subagent_type: Explore` and `model: "sonnet"`. Each agent gets a track-specific brief:

| Track | Focus | Sources |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `clone-detection` | Type-4 clone literature, embedding-based detection updates, 2024-2025 papers | Google Scholar, arxiv.org, ACM digital library, ASE/ICSE/MSR proceedings |
| `llm-failure-modes` | LLM and agent write-ups on "agents prefer generating over reusing", "fresh code vs existing helper" | Anthropic and OpenAI blogs, simonwillison.net, HN comments on agent posts, awesome-ai-agents |
| `framework-dedup` | Framework-specific dedup patterns (Rails refactor guides, SwiftUI view-composition, React custom-hooks) | thoughtbot, evilmartians, Hacking with Swift, Kent C. Dodds, Sundell, Majid |
| `design-system-convergence` | Design system literature on component drift and token convergence | Brad Frost, Nathan Curtis, design.systems, Figma blog |
| `prose-dedup` | Documentation and content dedup (single-sourcing, content fragments, docs-as-code) | Google developer doc style, write-the-docs, Diátaxis |

Each agent's brief:

```
You are a research subagent for the drydry plugin.

Track: <track name>
Focus: <track focus>
Since: <since date>
Existing drydry checklist patterns to NOT re-propose: <list>

Tasks:
1. WebSearch for new ideas, tools, and patterns in this track since
   <since date>. Use multiple query angles.
2. For each promising result, WebFetch the full page and read it.
3. Identify candidate patterns that drydry's existing checklist does
   not already cover.
4. For each candidate: write a paragraph, list two grep-friendly
   signatures, cite two sources with one-line takeaways.

Return a markdown report. Do not invent citations. Do not paste
abstracts; explain in your own words. Skip patterns where you cannot
produce a runnable signature.
```

Privacy: no project names, no employer names, no operator names in queries. Track focus stays on the technique, not the case.

#### Interim synthesis (depth: normal and deep)

Read the five reports. Identify:

1. Patterns that appear in multiple tracks (high-confidence candidates).
2. Patterns that appear in one track with weak sourcing (parking lot).
3. Contradictions or active debates (mark for the contrarian round).
4. Verifier-convention insights orthogonal to the patterns themselves (new grep tactics, new ast-grep idioms, new design-token-inspector tools).

#### Round 2: Depth (depth: normal and deep)

For the top three to five high-confidence candidates from the interim synthesis, spawn one Sonnet agent per candidate to go deeper: read more sources, find counter-examples, confirm the signatures actually grep cleanly against open-source codebases the agent can browse on GitHub.

#### Round 3: Contrarian (depth: deep only)

For the patterns surviving round 2, spawn one Opus agent with a contrarian brief: "find evidence that this pattern is wrong, redundant with an existing drydry pattern, or specific to a niche the operator does not work in". Classify each surviving candidate as `robust` / `probable` / `fragile` based on whether the contrarian could refute it.

### 3. WRITE

Synthesise the surviving candidates into the output file at `~/.claude/drydry/learnings/<date>-<topic>.md`. Group by proposed seed domain. Include the Detection method paragraph (Chapter 8) so the operator can reproduce the research.

### 4. NOTIFY

Return to the caller: count of new pattern proposals, by-domain breakdown, path to the artefact, and a one-line summary of any verifier-convention updates.

## Rules

- **No auto-merge.** This skill writes proposals, never edits the seed templates in `drydry:checklist`. The operator decides.
- **Citation hygiene.** Every pattern carries at least two sources with one-line takeaways. A pattern with one weak source goes into the `## Parking lot` section, not into `## New patterns`.
- **Signature-first.** A candidate without a grep-friendly signature is dropped. Drydry's downstream `sweep` needs the signature; an unproveable pattern is decoration.
- **Token budget.** Quick depth is one round per track (5 agents); normal is round 1 + round 2 (~10 agents); deep is rounds 1+2+3 (~14 agents including one Opus). The skill logs the budget choice in `## Detection method chosen` so the operator can reproduce.
- **Privacy.** No project names, employer names, or operator names appear in any external query. The skill works on technique, not on the operator's specific situation.
